**Figure 6b.**
A t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) graph embeds high-dimensional data into a two-dimensional space for visualization where similar nodes are grouped together. We visualize the topics in Figure 6a as labeled by color. Each node represents an individual tweet and only tweets posted by the day are shown in the foreground, while all tweets in the study period are shown in the background. Hovering over any node will show the text of tweets and the days they were posted.
